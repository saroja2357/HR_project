The goal is to explore and visualize key HR metrics to support strategic decision-making in talent management. The project utilizes Tableau for dashboard development and SQL for querying structured synthetic HR data, uncovering trends in employee performance, retention, demographics, and salary distribution. By transforming raw HR data into actionable insights, the project enables organizations to enhance workforce planning and reduce reporting inefficiencies.
